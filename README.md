# Basic-Calculator---Kotlin
A Calculator that does basic arithmetic using Kotlin in Intellij that can do division, subtraction, multiplication, addition, square root, and exponents. This Kotlin calculator program allows users to perform arithmetic operations, validate inputs, store calculation history using a data class, handle errors with try-catch blocks, and utilize loops and the when keyword for operation selection, ensuring a user-friendly experience. 

# Kotlin Basic Calculator Overview

My goal for this project was to get an introduction into the Koltin programming language by creating a Basic calculator. I used Intellij for this project because I felt it was an easier program to help me understand Kotlin.

This project uses data types, control structures, and object oriented features within Kotlin.

This software is capable of performing basic math opperations such as addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication.

# Future Work

The Basic Calculator works well, but there are a few things that could be improved:

Add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make the app easier to use.
Include more advanced operations like square roots and exponents.
Improve the error handling to manage invalid inputs and cases like dividing by zero.
Refactor the code to make it easier to test and ensure it works correctly in all situations.
